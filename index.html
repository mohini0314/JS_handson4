      wants to know how many M unique color shirts are left in the wardrobe. 
      Prepbuddy wants you to find M.

    <h1>10) Min and Max</h1> 
    <p> Congratulations on making up to this question. Let us give you a fairly simple 
       array problem to solve. If you know how to iterate through the array, you will <br>
       easily be able to solve this.
    <br><br>
    Note: The problem statement is simple- given N elements, find the minimum and maximum 
    numbers among those elements.</p>
    <pre>
      function arrayMin(arr) 
      {
      return Math.min(...arr);
      }
      function arrayMax(arr)

      share a contiguous segment of the chocolate bar selected such that the <br>
      length of the segment matches Yatharth's birth month M and the sum of the 
      integers on the squares is equal to his birthday D.
